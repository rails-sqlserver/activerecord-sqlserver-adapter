# standard-custom

This gem provides a [lint_roller](https://github.com/standardrb/lint_roller)
plugin configuration for the
[standard-custom](https://github.com/standardrb/standard-custom/blob/main/config/base.yml) ruleset.
It, along with
[standard-performance](https://github.com/standardrb/standard-performance), is
configured by default by the [Standard Ruby
gem](https://github.com/standardrb/standard)

In general, if you're using Standard, you won't need to install or configure
this gem manually, so there's not much to cover in this README!
