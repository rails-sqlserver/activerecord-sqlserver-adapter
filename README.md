## Supporting TinyTDS/Adapter

Both TinyTDS and the Rails SQL Server Adapter are MIT-licensed open source projects. Its ongoing development is made possible thanks to the support by these awesome [backers](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds/blob/master/BACKERS.md). If you'd like to join them, check out our [Patreon Campaign](https://www.patreon.com/metaskills).


## About The Adapter

The SQL Server adapter for ActiveRecord v5.1 using SQL Server 2012 or higher.

Interested in older versions? We follow a rational versioning policy that tracks Rails. That means that our 5.0.x version of the adapter is only for the latest 5.0 version of Rails. If you need the adapter for SQL Server 2008 or 2005, you are still in the right spot. Just install the latest 3.2.x to 4.1.x version of the adapter that matches your Rails version. We also have stable branches for each major/minor release of ActiveRecord.

#### Native Data Type Support

We support every data type supported by FreeTDS. All simplified Rails types in migrations will coorespond to a matching SQL Server national (unicode) data type. Always check the `initialize_native_database_types` [(here)](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter/blob/master/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/sqlserver/schema_statements.rb#L243) for an updated list.

The following types (date, datetime2, datetimeoffset, time) all require TDS version 7.3 with TinyTDS. We recommend using FreeTDS 1.0 or higher which default to using `TDSVER` to "7.3". The adapter also sets TinyTDS's `tds_version` to this as well if non is specified.

The Rails v5 adapter supports ActiveRecord's `datetime_with_precision` setting. This means that passing `:precision` to a datetime column is supported. Using a pecision with the `:datetime` type will signal the adapter to use the `datetime2` type under the hood.


#### Identity Inserts with Triggers

The adapter uses `OUTPUT INSERTED` so that we can select any data type key, for example UUID tables. However, this poses a problem with tables that use triggers. The solution requires that we use a more complex insert statement which uses a temporary table to select the inserted identity. To use this format you must declare your table exempt from the simple output inserted style with the table name into a concurrent hash. Optionally, you can set the data type of the table's primary key to return.

```ruby
adapter = ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerAdapter

# Will assume `bigint` as the id key temp table type.
adapter.exclude_output_inserted_table_names['my_table_name'] = true

# Explicitly set the data type for the temporary key table.
adapter.exclude_output_inserted_table_names['my_uuid_table_name'] = 'uniqueidentifier'
```


#### Force Schema To Lowercase

Although it is not necessary, the Ruby convention is to use lowercase method names. If your database schema is in upper or mixed case, we can force all table and column names during the schema reflection process to be lowercase. Add this to your config/initializers file for the adapter.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerAdapter.lowercase_schema_reflection = true
```


#### Schemas & Users

Depending on your user and schema setup, it may be needed to use a table name prefix of `dbo.`. So something like this in your initializer file for ActiveRecord or the adapter.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.table_name_prefix = 'dbo.'
```


#### Configure Connection & App Name

We currently conform to an unpublished and non-standard AbstractAdapter interface to configure connections made to the database. To do so, just override the `configure_connection` method in an initializer like so. In this case below we are setting the `TEXTSIZE` to 64 megabytes. Also, TinyTDS supports an application name when it logs into SQL Server. This can be used to identify the connection in SQL Server's activity monitor. By default it will use the `appname` from your database.yml file or a lowercased version of your Rails::Application name. It is now possible to define a `configure_application_name` method that can give you per instance details. Below shows how you might use this to get the process id and thread id of the current connection.

```ruby
module ActiveRecord
  module ConnectionAdapters
    class SQLServerAdapter < AbstractAdapter

      def configure_connection
        raw_connection_do "SET TEXTSIZE #{64.megabytes}"
      end

      def configure_application_name
        "myapp_#{$$}_#{Thread.current.object_id}".to(29)
      end

    end
  end
end
```

#### Executing Stored Procedures

Every class that sub classes ActiveRecord::Base will now have an execute_procedure class method to use. This method takes the name of the stored procedure which can be a string or symbol and any number of variables to pass to the procedure. Arguments will automatically be quoted per the connection's standards as normal. For example:

```ruby
Account.execute_procedure :update_totals, 'admin', nil, true
# Or with named parameters.
Account.execute_procedure :update_totals, named: 'params'
```

#### Explain Support (SHOWPLAN)

The 3.2 version of the adapter support ActiveRecord's explain features. In SQL Server, this is called the showplan. By default we use the `SHOWPLAN_ALL` option and format it using a simple table printer. So the following ruby would log the plan table below it.

```ruby
Car.where(id: 1).explain
```

```
EXPLAIN for: SELECT [cars].* FROM [cars] WHERE [cars].[id] = 1

```

You can configure a few options to your needs. First is the max column width for the logged table. The default value is 50 characters. You can change it like so.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServer::Showplan::PrinterTable.max_column_width = 500
```

Another configuration is the showplan option. Some might find the XML format more useful. If you have Nokogiri installed, we will format the XML string. I will gladly accept pathches that make the XML printer more useful!

```ruby
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerAdapter.showplan_option = 'SHOWPLAN_XML'
```
**NOTE:** The method we utilize to make SHOWPLANs work is very brittle to complex SQL. There is no getting around this as we have to deconstruct an already prepared statement for the sp_executesql method. If you find that explain breaks your app, simple disable it. Do not open a github issue unless you have a patch.  Please [consult the Rails guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#running-explain) for more info.


## Installation

The adapter has no strict gem dependencies outside of ActiveRecord. You will have to pick a connection mode, the default is dblib which uses the TinyTDS gem. Just bundle the gem and the adapter will use it.

```ruby
gem 'tiny_tds'
gem 'activerecord-sqlserver-adapter'
```
