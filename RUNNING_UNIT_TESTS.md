# How To Run The Test!

This process is much easier than it has been before!

## MS SQL SERVER

If you don't have easy access to MS SQL Server, you can set up a Vagrant/VirtualBox virtual machine with MS SQL Server. [Here's how](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter-dev-box).

## TL;DR

Default testing uses DBLIB with TinyTDS.

* Setup two databases in SQL Server, [activerecord_unittest] and [activerecord_unittest2]
* Create a [rails] user with an empty password and give it a [db_owner] role to both DBs. Some tests require a server role of [sysadmin] too. More details below with DDL SQL examples.
* $ bundle install
* $ bundle exec rake test ACTIVERECORD_UNITTEST_HOST='my.db.net'

Focusing tests. Use the `ONLY_` env vars to run either ours or the ActiveRecord cases. Use the `TEST_FILES` env variants to focus on specific test(s), use commas for multiple cases. Note, you have to use different env vars to focus only on ours or a core ActiveRecord case. There may be failures when focusing on an ActiveRecord case since our coereced test files is not loaded in this scenerio.

```
$ bundle exec rake test ONLY_SQLSERVER=1
$ bundle exec rake test ONLY_ACTIVERECORD=1

$ bundle exec rake test TEST_FILES="test/cases/adapter_test_sqlserver.rb"
$ bundle exec rake test TEST_FILES_AR="test/cases/finder_test.rb"
```


## Creating the test databases

The default names for the test databases are `activerecord_unittest` and `activerecord_unittest2`. If you want to use another database name then be sure to update the connection file that matches your connection method in test/connections/native_sqlserver_#{connection_method}/connection.rb. Define a user named 'rails' in SQL Server with all privileges granted for the test databases. Use an empty password for said user.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE [activerecord_unittest];
CREATE DATABASE [activerecord_unittest2];
GO
CREATE LOGIN [rails] WITH PASSWORD = '', CHECK_POLICY = OFF, DEFAULT_DATABASE = [activerecord_unittest];
GO
USE [activerecord_unittest];
CREATE USER [rails] FOR LOGIN [rails];
GO
EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', N'rails';
EXEC master..sp_addsrvrolemember @loginame = N'rails', @rolename = N'sysadmin'
GO
```

## Cloning The Repos

The tests of this adapter depend on the existence of the Rails which are automatically cloned for you with bundler. However you can clone Rails from git://github.com/rails/rails.git and set the `RAILS_SOURCE` environment variable so bundler will use another local path instead.

```
$ git clone git://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter.git
```

Suggest just letting bundler do all the work and assuming there is a git tag for the Rails version, you can set `RAILS_VERSION` before bundling.

```
$ export RAILS_VERSION='4.2.0'
$ bundle install
```


## Configure DB Connection

Please consult the `test/config.yml` file which is used to parse the configuration options for the DB connections when running tests. This file has overrides for any connection mode that you can set using simple environment variables. Assuming you are using FreeTDS 0.91 and above

```
$ export ACTIVERECORD_UNITTEST_HOST='my.db.net'   # Defaults to localhost
$ export ACTIVERECORD_UNITTEST_PORT='1533'        # Defaults to 1433
```

If you have FreeTDS installed and/or want to use a named dataserver in your freetds.conf file

```
$ export ACTIVERECORD_UNITTEST_DATASERVER='mydbname'
```

These can be passed down to rake too.

```
$ bundle exec rake test ACTIVERECORD_UNITTEST_HOST='my.db.net'
```


## Bundling

Now with that out of the way you can run "bundle install" to hook everything up. Our tests use bundler to setup the load paths correctly. The default mode is DBLIB using TinyTDS. It is important to use bundle exec so we can wire up the ActiveRecord test libs correctly.

```
$ bundle exec rake test
```


## Testing Options


By default, Bundler will download the Rails git repo and use the git tag that matches the dependency version in our gemspec. If you want to test another version of Rails, you can either temporarily change the :tag for Rails in the Gemfile. Likewise, you can clone the Rails repo your self to another directory and use the `RAILS_SOURCE` environment variable.


## Troubleshooting

* Make sure your firewall is off or allows SQL Server traffic both ways, typically on port 1433.
* Ensure that you are running on a local admin login to create the Rails user.
* Possibly change the SQL Server TCP/IP properties in "SQL Server Configuration Manager -> SQL Server Network Configuration -> Protocols for MSSQLSERVER", and ensure that TCP/IP is enabled and the appropriate entries on the "IP Addresses" tab are enabled.
