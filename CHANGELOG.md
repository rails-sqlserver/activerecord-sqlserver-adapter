## v4.2.0

#### Added

* New `ActiveRecord::Type` objects. See `active_record/connection_adapters/sqlserver/type` dir.
* New `SQLServer::Utils::Name` object for decomposing and quoting SQL Server names/identifiers.
* Support for most all SQL Server types in schema statements and dumping.

#### Changed

* The `create_database` now takes an options hash. Only key/value now is `collation`. Unknown keys just use raw values for SQL.
* Complete rewrite of our Arel visitor. Focuing on 2012 and upward so we can make FETCH happen.
* Testing enhancements.
  * Guard support, check our Guardfile.
  * Use `ARTest` namespace with `SQLServer` module for our helpers/objects.
  * Simple 2012 schmea addition and extensive column/type_cast object tests.
* Follow Rails convention and remove varying character default limits.
* The `cs_equality_operator` is now s class configuration property only.

#### Deprecated

* n/a

#### Removed

* SQL Server versions < 2012 which do not support OFFSET and FETCH. http://bit.ly/1B5Bwsd
* The `enable_default_unicode_types` option. Default to national types all the time.
* Native type configs for older DB support. Includes the following with new default value:
  * native_string_database_type => `nvarchar`
  * native_text_database_type   => `nvarchar(max)`
  * native_binary_database_type => `varbinary(max)`
* Various version and inspection methods removed. These include:
  * database_version
  * database_year
  * product_level
  * product_version
  * edition
* Removed tests for old issue #164. Handled by core types now.

#### Fixed

* Default lock is now "WITH (UPDLOCK)". Fixes #368

#### Security

* The connection's `inspect` method no longer returns sensitive connection info. Very basic now.
