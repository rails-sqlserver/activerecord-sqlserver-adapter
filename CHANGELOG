* Rake tasks methods for vanilla rails :db namespace parity. [Ken Collins]

* IronRuby integrated security fixes [Jimmy Schementi]


* 2.3.5

* Initial IronRuby ADONET connection mode support baked right in. Removed most &block 
  parameters, no handle/request object yielded anymore. Better abstraction and compliance 
  per the ActiveRecord abstract adapter to not yielding handles for #execute and only for 
  low level #select. Better wrapping of all queries at lowest level in #log so exceptions 
  at anytime can be handled correctly by core AR. Critical for System::Data's command 
  readers. Better abstraction for introspecting on #connection_mode. Added support for 
  running singular test cases via TextMate's Command-R. [Ken Collins]

* Allow adapter to return multiple results sets, for example from stored procedures. [Chris Hall]


* 2.3.4

* For tables that named with schema(ex. rails.users), they could not get length of column.
  column of varchar(40) gets length => nil. Ticket #27 & #15 [Ken Tachiya]

* Altered limited_update_conditions regex conditions, the .* would greedily fail 
  if the where_sql had WHERE in a table or field, etc. [Ransom Briggs]

* Changing test to allow ENV['ARUNIT_DB_NAME'] as the database name for the test units. 
  Matches up with AR conventions. [Ransom Briggs]


2.3.3
  
* Revert #ad83df82 and again cache column information at the connection's instance. The 
  previous commit was causing all sorts of view and schema reflection problems. [Ken Collins]

* Insert queries that include the word "insert" as a partial column name with the word 
  "id" as a value were falsely being matched as identity inserts. [Sean Caffery/bfabry]

* Delegate all low level #raw_connection calls to #raw_connection_run and #raw_connection_do
  which abstract out the low level modes in the connection options at that point. [Ken Collins]

* Leave order by alone when same column crosses two tables [Ransom Briggs]


* 2.3 * (December 1st, 2009)

* Coerce a few tests that were failing in 2.3.x [Ken Collins]

* Change column/view cache to happen at class level. Allows connection pool to share same
  caches as well as the ability to expire the caches when needed. Also fix change_column so 
  that exceptions are not raised when the column contains an existing default. [Ken Collins]

* Allow query_requires_identity_insert? method to return quoted table name in situations where the 
  INSERT parts are not quoted themselves. [Gary/iawgens, Richard Penwell, Ken Collins]

* Fixed namespace in calling test_sqlserver_odbc within test_unicode_types. [Gary/iawgens]

* 2.2.22 * (October 15th, 2009)

* Support Identity-key-column judgement on multiple schema environment [Ken Tachiya]

* Add support for tinyint data types. In MySQL all these types would be boolean, however in 
  our adapter, they will use the full 1 => 255 Fixnum value as you would expect. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.21 * (September 10th, 2009)

* Changes for gem best practices per http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/9/1/gem-packaging-best-practices
  Details of such are as follows: [Ken Collins]
  - Removed rails-sqlserver-2000-2005-adapter.rb load file for old github usage.
  - Move the core_ext directory to active_record/connection_adapters/sqlserver_adapter/core_ext
  - Renamespace SQLServerDBI to ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerCoreExtensions::DBI
  - Renamespace ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerActiveRecordExtensions to ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerCoreExtensions::ActiveRecord


* 2.2.20 * (September 10th, 2009)

* Implement a new remove_default_constraint method that uses sp_helpconstraint [Ken Collins]

* Use a lazy match in add_order_by_for_association_limiting! to allow sub selects to be used. Resolves 
  ticket #11.

* Add default rake task back for testing. Runs the namespaced sqlserver:test_sqlserver_odbc. 
  Resolves ticket #10 [Ken Collins]

* Default value detection in column_definitions is kinder to badly formatted, or long winded user
  defined functions, for default values. Resolves ticket #8 [Ken Collins]

* Make sure bigint SQL Server data type can be used and converted back to Bignum as expected. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.19 * (June 19th, 2009)

* Leave quoted column names as is. Resolves ticket #36 [Vince Puzzella]

* Changing add_limit! in ActiveRecord::Base for SQLServer so that it passes through any scoped :order 
  parameters. Resolves ticket #35 [Murray Steele]


* 2.2.18 * (June 5th, 2009)

* Column reflection on table name rescues LoadError and a few others. Resolves tickets #25 & #33 [Ken Collins]

* Added 2008 support. Resolves ticket #32 [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.17 * (May 14th, 2009)

* Add simplified type recognition for varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) under SQL Server 2005 to be a 
  :text type. This ensures schema dumper does the right thing. Fixes ticket #30. [Ken Collins]

* Tested ruby 1.9, ruby-odbc 0.9996, and DBI 0.4.1. Also added correct support for UTF-8 character 
  encoding going in and out of the DB. See before gist http://gist.github.com/111709 and after gist 
  http://gist.github.com/111719 [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.16 * (April 21st, 2009)

* Make add_limit_offset! only add locking hints (for tally) when the :lock option is present. Added tests 
  to make sure tally SQL is augmented correctly and tests to make sure that add_lock! is doing what it needs 
  for deep sub selects in paginated results. [Ken Collins]

* Add auto reconnect support utilizing a new #with_auto_reconnect block. By default each query run through 
  the adapter will automatically reconnect at standard intervals, logging attempts along the way, till success 
  or the original exception bubbles up. See docs for more details. Resolves ticket #18 [Ken Collins] 

* Update internal helper method #orders_and_dirs_set to cope with an order clause like "description desc". This 
  resolves ticket #26 [Ken Collins]

* Provide support for running queries at different isolation levels using #run_with_isolation_level method 
  that can take a block or not. Also implement a #user_options method that reflects on the current user 
  session values. Resolves #20 [Murray Steele]


* 2.2.15 * (March 23rd, 2009)

* Better add_lock! method that can add the lock to just about all the elements in the statement. This 
  could be eager loaded associations, joins, etc. Done so that paginated results can easily add lock 
  options for performance. Note, the tally count in add_limit_offset! use "WITH (NOLOCK)" explicitly 
  as it can not hurt and is needed. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.14 * (March 17th, 2009)

* Rails2.3 - Back passing tests on 2.2 work. Includes: (1) Created new test helpers that check ActiveRecord 
  version strings so we can conditionally run 2.2 and 2.3 tests. (2) Making TransactionTestSqlserver use Ship vs 
  Bird model. Also made it conditional run a few blocks for different versions of ActiveRecord. (3) Previous 
  JoinDependency#aliased_table_name_for is now only patched in ActiveRecord equal or greater than 2.3. [Ken Collins]

* Rails2.3 - Implement new savepoint support [Ken Collins]
  http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/383
  http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/sqlservertransactions.aspx

* Rails2.3 - Coerce NestedScopingTest#test_merged_scoped_find to use correct regexp for adapter. [Ken Collins]

* Rails2.3 - Implement a custom ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods::JoinDependency::JoinAssociation#aliased_table_name_for
  method that uses a Regexp.escape so that table/column quoting does not get ignored. [Ken Collins]

* Rails2.3 - Implement #outside_transaction? and a new transaction test case to test some SQL Server 
  basic support while implementing this method. Future home of some savepoint tests too. [Ken Collins]

* Rails2.3 - Coerced tests that ensure hash conditions on referenced tables are considered when eager 
  loading with limit/offset. Information on these changes and the ticket in rails are.
  http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9a4d557713acb0fc8e80f61af18094034aca029a
  http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/1404-conditions_tables-doesnt-understand-condition-hashes

* Rails2.3 - Add coerced tests for true/false attributes in selects use SQL Server case statement. [Ken Collins]

* Making sure that smalldatetime types are OK to use. Also fixed a bug in the #view_information method that 
  checks to see if a view definition is equal to 4000 chars, meaning that it is most likely truncated and 
  needs to use the backup method of sp_helptext to get it's view definition. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.13 * (February 10th, 2009)

* Update #indexes to use unqualified table name. Fixes cases where users may decide to use table 
  name prefixes like 'dbo.'. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.12 * (February 8th, 2009)

* Update table_exists? to work with qualified table names that may include an user prefix. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.10/11 * (January 22nd, 2009)

* Add a rails-sqlserver-2000-2005-adapter.rb file so that long :lib option for config.gem is no longer needed.


* 2.2.9 * (January 22nd, 2009)

* Fixing a small bug in the deprecated DBI::Timestamp conversion so it correctly converts nanosecond whole 
  numbers to back to pre type cast SQL Server milliseconds, ultimately allow ruby's Time#usec which is 
  microseconds to be correct. [Ken Collins]
  
* Sometimes views are more than 4000 chars long and will return NULL for the VIEW_DEFINITION. If so, use 
  sp_helptext procedure as a backup method. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.8 (January 9th, 2009)

* Update execute_procedure method a bit to remove excess code. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.7 (January 9th, 2009)

* Created a connection#execute_procedure method that takes can take any number of ruby objects as variables 
  and quotes them according to the connection's rules. Also added an ActiveRecord::Base class level core 
  extension that hooks into this. It also checks if the connection responds to #execute_procedure and if 
  not returns an empty array. [Ken Collins]

* Added a #enable_default_unicode_types class attribute access to make all new added or changed string types 
  like :string/:text default to unicode/national data types. See the README for full details. Added a rake 
  task that assists setting this to true when running tests.  [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.6 (January 8th, 2009)

* Introduced a bug in 2.2.5 in the #add_order! core ext for ActiveRecord. Fixed [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.5 (January 4th, 2009)

* Added a log_info_schema_queries class attribute and make all queries to INFORMATION_SCHEMA silent by 
  default. [Ken Collins]

* Fix millisecond support in datetime columns. ODBC::Timestamp incorrectly takes SQL Server milliseconds
  and applies them as nanoseconds. We cope with this at the DBI layer by using SQLServerDBI::Type::SqlserverTimestamp 
  class to parse the before type cast value appropriately. Also update the adapters #quoted_date method 
  to work more simply by converting ruby's #usec milliseconds to SQL Server microseconds. [Ken Collins]

* Core extensions for ActiveRecord now reflect on the connection before doing SQL Server things. Now 
  this adapter is compatible for using with other adapters. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.4 (December 5th, 2008)

* Fix a type left in #views_real_column_name. Also cache #view_information lookups. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.3 (December 5th, 2008)

* Changing back to using real table name in column_definitions. Makes sure views get back only the columns 
  that are defined for them with correct names, etc. Now supporting views by looking for NULL default and 
  then if table name is a view, perform a targeted with sub select to the real table name and column name 
  to find true default. [Ken Collins]

* Ensure that add_limit_offset! does not alter sub queries. [Erik Bryn]


2.2.2 (December 2nd, 2008)

* Add support for view defaults by making column_definitions use real table name for schema info. [Ken Collins]

* Include version in connection method and inspection. [Ken Collins]


2.2.1 (November 25th, 2008)

* Add identity insert support for views. Cache #views so that identity #table_name_or_views_table_name 
  will run quickly. [Ken Collins]

* Add views support. ActiveRecord classes can use views. The connection now has a #views method and 
  #table_exists? will now fall back to checking views too. [Ken Collins]


2.2.0 (November 21st, 2008)

* Release for rails 2.2.2. Many many changes.  [Ken Collins], [Murray Steele], [Shawn Balestracci], [Joe Rafaniello]
