# ActiveRecord SQL Server Adapter. For SQL Server 2012 And Higher.

**This project is looking for a new maintainers. Join the [discusion here](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter/issues/364)**

The SQL Server adapter for ActiveRecord. If you need the adapter for SQL Server 2000, you are still in the right spot. Just install the latest 2.3.x version of the adapter. Note, we follow a rational versioning policy that tracks ActiveRecord. That means that our 2.3.x version of the adapter is only for the latest 2.3 version of Rails. We also have stable branches for each major/minor release of ActiveRecord.


## What's New

* Rails 4.0 and 4.1 support
* Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 support


#### Testing Rake Tasks Support

This is a long story, but if you are not working with a legacy database and you can trust your schema.rb to setup your local development or test database, then we have adapter level support for rails :db rake tasks. Please read this wiki page for full details.

http://wiki.github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter/rails-db-rake-tasks


#### Executing Stored Procedures

Every class that sub classes ActiveRecord::Base will now have an execute_procedure class method to use. This method takes the name of the stored procedure which can be a string or symbol and any number of variables to pass to the procedure. Arguments will automatically be quoted per the connection's standards as normal. For example:

```ruby
Account.execute_procedure :update_totals, 'admin', nil, true
# Or with named parameters.
Account.execute_procedure :update_totals, named: 'params'
```

#### Native Data Type Support

Currently the following custom data types have been tested for schema definitions.

* char
* nchar
* nvarchar
* ntext
* varchar(max)
* nvarchar(max)

For example:

```ruby
create_table :sql_server_custom_types, force: true do |t|
  t.column :ten_code,       :char,      limit: 10
  t.column :ten_code_utf8,  :nchar,     limit: 10
  t.column :title_utf8,     :nvarchar
  t.column :body,           :varchar_max    # Creates varchar(max)
  t.column :body_utf8,      :ntext
  t.column :body2_utf8,     :nvarchar_max   # Creates nvarchar(max)
end
```

Manually creating a `varchar(max)` is not necessary since this is the default type created when specifying a `:text` field. As time goes on we will be testing other SQL Server specific data types are handled correctly when created in a migration.


#### Force Schema To Lowercase

Although it is not necessary, the Ruby convention is to use lowercase method names. If your database schema is in upper or mixed case, we can force all table and column names during the schema reflection process to be lowercase. Add this to your config/initializers file for the adapter.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerAdapter.lowercase_schema_reflection = true
```


#### Schemas & Users

Depending on your user and schema setup, it may be needed to use a table name prefix of `dbo.`. So something like this in your initializer file for ActiveRecord or the adapter.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.table_name_prefix = 'dbo.'
```


#### Auto Connecting

By default the adapter will auto connect to lost DB connections. For every query it will retry at intervals of 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 seconds. During each retry it will callback out to ActiveRecord::Base.did_retry_sqlserver_connection(connection,count). When all retries fail, it will callback to ActiveRecord::Base.did_lose_sqlserver_connection(connection). Both implementations of these methods are to write to the rails logger, however, they make great override points for notifications like Hoptoad. If you want to disable automatic reconnections use the following in an initializer.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerAdapter.auto_connect = false
```


#### Configure Connection & App Name

We currently conform to an unpublished and non-standard AbstractAdapter interface to configure connections made to the database. To do so, just override the `configure_connection` method in an initializer like so. In this case below we are setting the `TEXTSIZE` to 64 megabytes. Also, TinyTDS supports an application name when it logs into SQL Server. This can be used to identify the connection in SQL Server's activity monitor. By default it will use the `appname` from your database.yml file or a lowercased version of your Rails::Application name. It is now possible to define a `configure_application_name` method that can give you per instance details. Below shows how you might use this to get the process id and thread id of the current connection.

```ruby
module ActiveRecord
  module ConnectionAdapters
    class SQLServerAdapter < AbstractAdapter

      def configure_connection
        raw_connection_do "SET TEXTSIZE #{64.megabytes}"
      end

      def configure_application_name
        "myapp_#{$$}_#{Thread.current.object_id}".to(29)
      end

    end
  end
end
```

#### Explain Support (SHOWPLAN)

The 3.2 version of the adapter support ActiveRecord's explain features. In SQL Server, this is called the showplan. By default we use the `SHOWPLAN_ALL` option and format it using a simple table printer. So the following ruby would log the plan table below it.

```ruby
Car.where(id: 1).explain
```

```
EXPLAIN for: SELECT [cars].* FROM [cars] WHERE [cars].[id] = 1

```

You can configure a few options to your needs. First is the max column width for the logged table. The default value is 50 characters. You can change it like so.

```ruby
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServer::Showplan::PrinterTable.max_column_width = 500
```

Another configuration is the showplan option. Some might find the XML format more useful. If you have Nokogiri installed, we will format the XML string. I will gladly accept pathches that make the XML printer more useful!

```ruby
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLServerAdapter.showplan_option = 'SHOWPLAN_XML'
```
**NOTE:** The method we utilize to make SHOWPLANs work is very brittle to complex SQL. There is no getting around this as we have to deconstruct an already prepared statement for the sp_executesql method. If you find that explain breaks your app, simple disable it. Do not open a github issue unless you have a patch.  Please [consult the Rails guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#running-explain) for more info.

## Versions

The adapter follows a rational versioning policy that also tracks ActiveRecord's major and minor version. That means the latest 3.1.x version of the adapter will always work for the latest 3.1.x version of ActiveRecord.


## Installation

The adapter has no strict gem dependencies outside of ActiveRecord. You will have to pick a connection mode, the default is dblib which uses the TinyTDS gem. Just bundle the gem and the adapter will use it.

```ruby
gem 'tiny_tds'
gem 'activerecord-sqlserver-adapter', '~> 4.0.0'
```

If you want to use ruby ODBC, please use at least version 0.99992 since that contains fixes for both native types as well as fixes for proper encoding support under 1.9. If you have any troubles installing the lower level libraries for the adapter, please consult the wiki pages for various platform installation guides. Tons of good info can be found and we ask that you contribute too!
